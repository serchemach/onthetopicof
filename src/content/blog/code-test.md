title: Code markup test
---

Hello! This is a test of how code blocks are rendered
```
document.onkeyup = (event) => {
    console.log(1)
    if (event.ctrlKey && event.key === "ArrowUp"){
        let talentPoints = 0;
        while (talentPoints < 6) {
            reroll();
            talentPoints = getTalentPoints();
        }
    }
}
```
I think it will be fine for now...

Hi!, this is a hello post! 

It's the first one of (hopefully) at least a few ones.

A am very bad at design, as you may have already noticed.

I will try to improve it, although the main goal of making this blog was to make the markup as simple as possible (archaic even), because all my homies (and me) hate the modern bloated web.
