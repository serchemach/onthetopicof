I guess, for now, this will be a stub with some research materials. 

I will try to update it with new sources and some actual content as I go along with my work. 

Let's dump some papers:
- [Look and Feel What and How Recurrent Self-Organizing Maps Learn](https://hal.science/hal-02120117)
- [A Recurrent Self-Organizing Map for Temporal Sequence Processing](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-45240-9_1)
- [Recursive Self-Organizing Maps](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2501992_Recursive_Self-Organizing_Maps)
- [Recurrent Self-Organizing Map for Severe Weather Patterns Recognition](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Recurrent-Self-Organizing-Map-for-Severe-Weather-SÃ¡-Rocha/cd28872ad28d014364194fa70300ae2bbfe3f189)
- [Recursive self-organizing network models](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0893608004001510)

Luckly, there are some existing implementations:
- [somber (Somber Organizes Maps By Enabling Recurrence)](https://github.com/stephantul/somber)

Of course, we can't forget the basics/classics:
- [Self-Organizing Maps book by Teuvo Kohonen himself!](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-56927-2)
